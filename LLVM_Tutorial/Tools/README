This directory stores all the tests, which have their main functions and can generate standalone executable.

Please note that the Passes in the Implementaions directory will be first compiled into libraries in LLVM_Learner_Libs, for later linking.

Please also note that the Passes in the Implementations directory will be compiled into build/building and the cp will not overwrite the old .a file in the special pass table, so if you change
the Passes in the Implementations, you need to cp the new .a file from build/building to build or specific Pass table manually.
